This is a reddit data collector.

This reddit data collector program uses PRAW to collect data from Reddit.

There are 2 parts to this program; the first part it collects the data of only one post, the second part of the program it collects the data of 100-300 posts in one subreddit. You can use either.

This program is supposed to be used easily whether you have any coding experience or not. So you only need to run the code.


Part One: To run the program correctly for extracting the data, you need to provide the code with 5 pieces of info: 

1. Url of the post
2. Duration of data collection (ex: For setting the duration for 1 hour, give 60 to the program)
3. Data collection interval (ex: To collect data every 2 minutes, give 2)
4. Whether you want to know if the post is in hot in every data collection interval (true for yes and false for no)
5. The name of the output file (ex: post_332_data.xlsx)
